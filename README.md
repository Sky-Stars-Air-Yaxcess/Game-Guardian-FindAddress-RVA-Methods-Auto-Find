# Game-Guardian-FindAddress-RVA-Methods-Auto-Find
This script, created for Game Guardian, is a powerful and useful tool. It works exclusively on Unity il2cpp libil2cpp.so and helps to automatically find method addresses in a dump.cs file via method RVA. It's suitable for beginners to intermediate users.

This script was created for educational purposes only. Users are solely responsible for how they use it. We respect developers and urge them to fix vulnerabilities. Our goal is not to cause harm, but to promote fair and secure gameplay!

This works for any Unity game, but only on a 64-bit il2cpp build where you can create a game dump!

the clowns I have never stolen anything from anyone. If you see something similar, it means either someone actually stole from me, or it is a coincidence that it looks alike. It's also possible that we use the same work logic and code, which does not mean I have stolen anything.
